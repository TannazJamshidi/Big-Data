# Big-Data
bikes_RDD and bikes_DF consider the occupancy of bike stations, where users can both pick up and drop off bikes in two different ways(data frame structure and RDD structure). The objective is to identify the most "critical" time slots (day of the week and hour) for each station.

The historical data is stored in register.csv, which includes information about the number of slots used and free for approximately 3000 stations spanning from May 2008 to September 2008.
station.csv provides descriptions of the stations.
